     * GlyphPainter provides a funciton which draws a glpyh into
     * a box in a color. It's both a component and a static function
     * to do the draw you can use in other contexts.
     *
     * The glyphs are enumerated below. To add a glyph you add to
     * that enum then draw it in the switch in GlyphPainter.cpp.
     *
     * Theres two strategies for the glyphs
     *
     * 1. Just paint them. Write code in GlpyhPainter.cpp with draw and
     *    stuff.
     * 2. Use an SVG. To add one with an SVG
     *    a. Add the svg to `res/glyphs/blah.svg`
     *    b. Add that svg to the CMakeLists in the cmrc_add_resource_librar
     *    c. In the GlpyhPainter handle the switch case to delegate by
     *       path.
     * FOr now you have to specify the base color and size of the SVG,
     * since the JUCE APIs to get these aren't super reliable. But really
     * they are all 24x24 0xFFAFAFAF in the Figma so it's just copy and paste
